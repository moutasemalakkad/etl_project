In this project we will be combining four data bases in addition to scraping a website that will help researching the following topics:
- Cause of death by Zipcode
- correlation between any given zipcode and the cause of death
- correlation between any given class and specifc type of death
- unemployment precentage in any given zipcode
- Know any zipcode's state based on the number that it starts with 


Challenges:
- Bining based on class
- Extracting the major cause of death per zip code and loading that into a table
- Scraping since there was no unique identifiers for each tag. 



Load:
- We will be uploading the data to both a local PG database and to MondoDB
